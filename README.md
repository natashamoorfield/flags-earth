# Flags of Earth

## What is This Project?

**Flags of Earth** is a set of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) representing the flags of various Tellurian nations and
administrative regions for use in the Calmarendian *Reader's Guide to Earth*.

## What it is not

Because of the limited remit of the project, **Flags of Earth** is certainly not intended to be a comprehensive resource: there plenty of other people out there who have done and are doing that far better than we could ever hope to and those that have inspired and informed our efforts will be acknowledged as soon as we get around to it.

Nor is it intended to be an accurate resource: note, particularly, that this project and its associated works is being created from the perspective of Earth as it existed on 10 April 1992, so it may not reflect changes - in the real timeline - that have occurred since then. The flag of Japan is a good example of this.

It should also be noted that, from a Calmarendian perspective, Earth exists in a different timeline to the one you may be used to and that the divergence of the timelines may have already caused some differences in detail which you may perceive as errors.

## License

Our understanding (which may not be perfect) is that flags are not subject to copyright. You may, therefore, treat everything within this project as being in the **Public Domain**, including the source code.
